  When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian
  sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but
  a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among
  the tall grass by the trickling stream;
  <p>
    and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by
    me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow
    familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies,
    then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image,
    and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it
    floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness
    overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and
    absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think
    with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress
    upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be
    the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God!
